          <h1><b>1. What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?</b></h1>
          <hr />
          <p class="overflow-auto">
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
            documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of
            objects, allowing programming languages (like JavaScript) to
            interact with the content, structure, and style of a web page.
          </p>
          <li>
            Key Features of the DOM: Tree Structure: The DOM organizes the
            document into a tree of nodes. For example, an HTML element like is
            represented as an element node, and its text content is represented
            as a text node. The relationships between elements, such as
            parent-child relationships, are preserved in the tree structure.
            Dynamic Interaction: The DOM enables developers to dynamically
            update the content, structure, and style of a webpage without
            reloading it. JavaScript can be used to modify elements, attributes,
            and styles, or to handle events like clicks and keypresses.
            Standardized API: The DOM provides standardized methods and
            properties for accessing and manipulating web documents. This
            includes methods like getElementById(), querySelector(), and
            addEventListener() to select and interact with elements, as well as
            properties like innerHTML and style.

          <hr />
          <p>
            Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript that allows you to
            handle events at a higher level in the DOM tree rather than
            attaching event listeners to individual child elements. It leverages
            the concept of event bubbling, where events triggered on a child
            element propagate (or "bubble up") through its ancestors in the DOM
            tree, allowing a parent element to listen for events on its
            children.
          </p>
          <li>
            Improved Performance: Instead of attaching separate event listeners
            to every child element (which can be inefficient if you have many
            elements), you attach just one listener to the parent element. This
            reduces memory usage and improves performance, especially when
            dealing with a large number of child elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Handles Dynamically Added Elements: Event delegation is particularly
            useful when new child elements are added dynamically after the event
            listener is already set. Without delegation, you'd need to add new
            event listeners manually to every new element. With event
            delegation, the parent listener will automatically catch events from
            newly added children.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplified Code: It simplifies event handling code by allowing you
            to manage events in a single location (the parent), rather than
            setting up multiple listeners on each child element.

          <p>
            If you want to change other attributes like id , href , or src , you
            can use the setAttribute() method. The setAttribute() method accepts
            two arguments: The name of the attribute to set. The value of the
            attribute to set.
          </p>
          <li>
            1. Manipulating Attributes To manipulate an element's attributes
            (like src, href, id, etc.), you can use the following methods: a.
            Get an Attribute (getAttribute) Retrieve the value of an attribute
            from an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            b. Set or Change an Attribute (setAttribute) Set a new value for an
            attribute or update an existing one.
          </li>
          <li>
            c. Remove an Attribute (removeAttribute) Remove an attribute from an
            element.
